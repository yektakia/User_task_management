# User_task_management
I completed this project using Tkinter, which involves user management and task management. I store the data in a database as well. In the user management section, I added various features such as adding an admin, adding users, editing, and more. In the task management section, I implemented functionalities like adding tasks, deleting tasks, and similar features.
